Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After years of working as an English Teacher, I decided to switch into the world of Web Development, inspired by the ever expanding tech scene in Barcelona.

I have just finished studying at Ironhack where I went through an intensive bootcamp and learned about Frontend technologies, such as Javascript, React.js, HTML, CSS and Backend technologies such as MongoDB, Mongoose, NodeJS, ExpressJS and Axios.

In my spare time you can find me in the kitchen, in front of a potters wheel or exploring the wonderful city of Barcelona.

I am open to work and new opportunities and would love to have a chat. Feel free to reach out!
